# OnlineStore

OnlineStore displays all the products in the home page with search field. User can click on any of the product to see more detailed information about the product. Also, users can search for any particular product by simply providing the category name on the search input field.

## How to install

1. Clone the project `git clone https://github.com/ShivaAdhikari7/online-store`.

2. Install all the dependencies `npm install` or `npm i`.

3. Run the project `npm start`.

After these steps, the localhost server on port 3000 will start - [localhost](http://localhost:3000).

## How to use

After [localhost](http://localhost:3000) is started by the React development server, the home page should look like below:

![OnlineStore Home Page](/src/img_markdown/home_page.jpg)

Now, you can search for the product by category using search input field. I have searched for Electronics category products:

Also, you can view the details of certain product by clicking on it.
